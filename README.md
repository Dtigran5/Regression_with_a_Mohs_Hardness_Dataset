 your task is to use regression to predict the Mohs hardness of a mineral, given its properties.

 The dataset (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Prediction of Mohs Hardness with Machine Learning dataset. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original.

Files

train.csv - the training dataset; Hardness is the continuous target

test.csv - the test dataset; your objective is to predict the value of Hardness

sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format
